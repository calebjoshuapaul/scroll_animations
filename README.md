# Scroll Animation Web App

Welcome to my Scroll Animation Web App! This project showcases various scroll-based animations created using only HTML and CSS. 

## Live Preview

Check out the live preview of the web app [here](https://calebjoshua.me/scroll_animations/).
(Animations work only on chromium browsers as of now.)

## Features

- **Auto Rotate**: Elements smoothly rotate as you scroll down the page.
- **Auto Show**: Hidden elements gradually appear into view upon scrolling.
- **Auto Blur**: Elements become blurred as they scroll into or out of view.

## Usage

Simply scroll through the page to see the animations in action. No additional interaction is required.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure is simple and semantic, using basic elements to demonstrate the animations.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Scroll Animations</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="autoRotate">Rotate Animation</div>
    <div class="autoShow">Show Animation</div>
    <div class="autoBLur">Blur Animation</div>
</body>
</html>
